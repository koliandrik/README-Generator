  ## Description
  ```
  The README Generator is a command-line application designed to simplify the process of creating a professional README file for your projects. By leveraging the power of Node.js and the inquirer package, it prompts users for essential information about their project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and license choices. Once the user provides the necessary details, the generator automatically formats and generates a polished README.md file, ready to be added to the project repository. This tool aims to save time, ensure consistency across project documentation, and help developers focus more on their code rather than spending hours formatting their project documentation.
